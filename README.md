Senior Frontend Engineer with 7+ years of experience crafting web and mobile experiences. Currently based in Amsterdam 🇳🇱

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a product-minded developer who loves building robust, performant, user-centric applications. While my expertise lies in frontend development, I enjoy working across the full stack and implementing DevOps practices.

I enjoy:

- Building performant React Native apps that users love
- Writing clean, well-tested TypeScript code
- Automating everything that can be automated
- Making the web and mobile apps accessible to everyone
- Teaching and mentoring other developers
